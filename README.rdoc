== SYNOPSIS
* A case of the fixtures for the mongoid

== WHY?
* Fixtures can be kinda nice for classic rails workflow
* Some of us don't like factories
* Make real db calls

== REQUIREMENTS
* rails >= 3.0.0.rc
* mongoid >= 2.0.0.beta.7

== INSTALL
* gem install mongoid_rails_fixtures
* In your Gemfile, include:
  gem "mongoid_rails_fixtures", ">=0.0.1" # or current version
  
== OPTIONS
  to use, set these attributes after the Bunlder.require in your application.rb
* to migrate before test runs, optionally include
  +typewriter+Mongoid.configure.migrate_before_tests = true+typewriter+
* to stop the deletion of existing fixtures before create (a rails default), set
  +typewriter+Mongoid.configure.delete_existing_fixtures_before_create = false+typewriter+

== FEATURES AND HOW TO USE
* you can simply create your own fixture files
* I've been thinking about creating a generator but it seems to be overkill to automate the process
* place your fixtures as pluralized models either in .yml or .csv (e.g. users.yml) in your rails/test/fixtures directory
* execute with a standard call to
  +typewriter+rake test:units+typewriter+

== NOTES
* Original active_record/fixtures.rb is unchanged for association detection (so that likely doesn't work)
* Only tested with ruby 1.9.1

== TODO
* make association detection functional in fixtures.rb
*

== CREDITS TO
  * rails
  * mongoid

Much of this gem simply modifies existing code from both projects.
With that out of the way, on to the license.
