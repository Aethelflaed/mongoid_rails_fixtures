== SYNOPSIS
* Data migrations for Mongoid.

* You have model instances which you leverage as schema data

== REQUIREMENTS
* rails 3.0.0.beta3 ( should be cake updating for rails 3 final )
* mongoid

== REQUIRES
* mongoid_rails_migrations
* rails >= 3

== INSTALL
* gem install mongoid_rails_fixtures
* In your Gemfile, include:
  gem "mongoid_rails_fixtures", ">=0.0.1" # or current version
* to migrate before test runs, optionally include
  +typewriter+Mongoid.configure.migrate_before_tests = true+typewriter+

== FEATURES AND HOW TO USE
* you can simply create your own fixture files
* or use a generator:
  * rails generate mongoid:fixture your_fixture
* execute with a standard call to
  +typewriter+rake test:units+typewriter+

== NOTES
* original active_record/fixtures.rb is unchanged for association detection (so that likely doesn't work)

Much of this gem simply modifies existing code from both projects.
With that out of the way, on to the license.
